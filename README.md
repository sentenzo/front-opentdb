This one was made to consolidate my knowledge on React.

It's a small frontend-only project, which utilizes [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) (an open API for quizes).

The idea of the project was taken from [Scrimba React cours](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). They've also provided a nice design template: [link (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/file/Re5nbvHAjPXG7wfby7CJbq/Quizzical-App).
